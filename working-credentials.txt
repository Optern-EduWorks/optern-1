WORKING AUTHENTICATION CREDENTIALS
====================================

âœ… BOTH CANDIDATE AND RECRUITER LOGINS NOW WORKING:

Candidate Login:
- Email: candidate@test.com
- Password: password123
- Role: student (maps to 'candidate' in frontend)
- User ID: 18

âœ… Recruiter Login:
- Email: recruiter@test.com
- Password: password123
- Role: recruiter
- User ID: 17

ðŸ”§ FIXES APPLIED:
1. Removed test token fallback in auth interceptor that was interfering with real login
2. Removed fallback test user initialization in AuthService
3. Removed fallback test user logic in role guard
4. Fixed authentication flow to use actual JWT tokens instead of test tokens

The authentication system now works correctly for both candidates and recruiters without interference from development/testing fallbacks.
