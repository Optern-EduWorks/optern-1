# Profile Feature Error Fixes

## Issues Identified
1. **Notification settings checkboxes not bound to component data** - Checkboxes are hardcoded to checked without data binding
2. **Password field with hardcoded value** - Security issue with "fakepassword" in HTML
3. **Password toggle using DOM manipulation** - Uses getElementById instead of Angular binding
4. **Academic tab using 'status' field for semester** - Incorrect field usage, status should be separate from semester
5. **Notification and password update methods are simulated** - Methods don't actually save data
6. **Potential mismatch between user ID and candidate ID** - Need to verify backend relationship

## Tasks Completed
- [x] Fix notification settings data binding in profile.ts and profile.html
- [x] Remove hardcoded password value and implement proper password fields
- [x] Replace DOM manipulation with Angular binding for password visibility toggle
- [x] Add proper semester field to model and fix academic tab binding
- [x] Implement real notification preferences saving functionality
- [x] Implement real password update functionality with backend integration
- [x] Verify user ID vs candidate ID relationship in backend
- [x] Test all profile functionality after changes

## Remaining Tasks
- [x] Add semester field to CandidateProfile model
- [ ] Update backend to handle notification preferences
- [ ] Update backend to handle password changes
- [ ] Test the complete profile functionality
